                <p>N-Power Agro is the program designed to provide services to farmers across the country. Part of the focus is to support the development of efficient farming techniques and practices to maximize productivity in the agricultural sector.

The other side of the program provides technological and institutional development to farming communities in rural areas, places where the public service sector is particularly underrepresented. By creating a stronger link between rural and urban communities and centralizing the knowledge base while incorporating local knowledge and practices, the N-Power Agro program is built to link the diverse communities of Nigeria while promoting a modern economy.</p>

                <p>Fashion is a highly sophisticated, $2.5 trillion global industry. In the United States alone, consumers spent nearly $380 billion on apparel and footwear in 2017. The industry, which encompasses everything from textile and apparel brands to wholesalers, importers and retailers, employs more than 1.8 million people in the United States. 

The U.S. fashion industry has evolved from its roots in manufacturing to new high-value design and other creative jobs. As with many industries in the manufacturing sector, the United States now concentrates on the high-value parts of the apparel global supply chain: research and development (R&D), design and marketing.

The twin forces of technology and globalization have had enormous ripple effects in the fashion industry, similar to many other industries, and has created new trends, challenges and opportunities. The impacts of social media, new business models, advanced manufacturing, and changing demographics are leading to significant changes in all aspects of the fashion industry with the potential to reshape it for years to come.</p>

                <p>Established civil Engineering firms play an important role in economic development, a process that starts well before any sites are surveyed or foundations laid. A crucial role construction companies plays is to help local economic development boards and their directors gather the information they need to get their sites ready for industries to move in and quickly get up and running.

For example, in Georgia we work closely with our partners to get sites qualified for GRAD status where applicable. GRAD, named for the Georgia Ready for Accelerated Development (GRAD) Sites Program, is a critical project status as it demonstrates to businesses considering a move to Georgia that the surrounding community is ready, willing, and eager to work with them.

States with programs like GRAD help ensure a rapid and headache-free development process, and are at a competitive advantage in terms of attracting jobs. Npower usa sees the importance of construction engineers in the economy and try to bring up upcoming construction engineers by raising capitals for the lucky ones.  </p>

                <p> Government's responsibility to protect and advance the interests of society includes the delivery of high-quality health care. Because the market alone cannot ensure all Americans access to quality health care, the government must preserve the interests of its citizens by supplementing the market where there are gaps and regulating the market where there is inefficiency or unfairness. The ultimate goal of achieving high quality of care will require strong partnerships among federal, state, and local governments and the private sector. Translating general principles regarding the appropriate role of government into specific actions within a rapidly changing, decentralized delivery system will require the combined efforts of the public and private sectors.

                <p>Carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting, shaping and installation of building materials during the construction of buildings, ships, timber bridges, concrete formwork, etc. Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did rougher work such as framing, but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry. In the United States, 98.5% of carpenters are male, and it was the fourth most male-dominated occupation in the country in 1999. In 2006 in the United States, there were about 1.5 million carpentry positions. Carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave. Carpenters normally framed post-and-beam buildings until the end of the 19th century; now this old-fashioned carpentry is called timber framing. Carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training—normally 4 years—and qualify by successfully completing that country's competence test in places such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and South Africa. Skilled trade like capentry, welding, and the likes are most are acquired by people who have less capitals to start up or get the necessary machines like band saw, wood shaper etc using this medium provide basics in their workshops.</p>
